## Credits

This script is forked from
[another script](http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/149411)
by [Francois Marot](http://userscripts-mirror.org/users/487204.html).
The code of that script was perfectly correct, but it was not granted for
[GM_addStyle](http://wiki.greasespot.net/GM_addStyle) metadata,
thus not working on newer versions of Greasemonkey.
It was possibly written before Greasemonkey 2.0, since
from that version, [`@grant none`](http://wiki.greasespot.net/@grant)
is assumed by default, if no other values are specified.

This script adds the necessary metadata to make it working.
